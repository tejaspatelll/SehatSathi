A smart wearable ECG device designed for Rural India.
Kutch, Gujarat
Evolution of Prototypes
In rural India, healthcare accessibility is a significant challenge,
with only 30% of medical professionals serving 60% of the
population. My design project addresses this issue through an
innovative wearable AI-powered ECG monitoring device. This
device brings healthcare to people, making it more accessible
and less stigmatized.
The device features real-time ECG and activity monitoring, with
an AI system that detects anomalies and alerts users. Its design,
inspired by the cultural aesthetics of the Kutch region in
Gujarat, blends seamlessly into the local culture, making it more
acceptable and assimilating for users.
Sustainability and cultural sensitivity were key considerations
in the design process. The device is detachable, enhancing
sustainability by allowing it to be shared within the community
and protected during garment washing, aligning principles of
sharing and extending product lifespan. Additionally, the design
is culturally sensitive with user interactions and system flow
carefully designed to be user-friendly and effective.
This project demonstrates the power of design in addressing
real-world problems, highlighting the responsibilities of
designers to create innovative, sustainable, and ethically sound
solutions. By integrating advanced medical technology with
cultural sensitivity, this wearable ECG monitoring device aims
to transform healthcare accessibility in rural India.

INTRODUCTION
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and
its impact is particularly severe in rural India. Despite having lower
traditional risk factors, the rural population experiences disproportionately
high rates of major cardiovascular events, with over half of these cases
going undiagnosed (Kalra et al., 2023). This project aims to address these
healthcare challenges by developing a smart, culturally sensitive wearable
ECG diagnostic device tailored for the rural communities in Gujarat.
The primary objective of this project is to provide accessible and reliable
heart health monitoring for villagers who face significant barriers in
accessing urban healthcare facilities. By leveraging advanced point-of-care
(POC) technology and machine learning algorithms, the device facilitates
early detection and diagnosis of cardiovascular issues, enabling timely
medical intervention and improving health outcomes (Konwar & Borse,
2020; Maini et al., 2021).
INTRODUCTION
This initiative aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development
Goal Target 3.4, which focuses on reducing premature mortality from non-
communicable diseases through prevention, treatment, and promotion of
mental health and well-being. By enhancing healthcare access and quality
for underserved populations, this project not only aims to improve
individual health outcomes but also contributes to broader public health
goals in rural India.
Through innovative design and technology integration, the project seeks to
transform the management of cardiovascular health, offering a sustainable
and culturally appropriate solution to one of the most pressing healthcare
challenges in rural India.
LOCATION
For this project, the focus is on villages in Kutch region in Gujarat, where
healthcare accessibility remains a critical challenge. Approximately 57.4% of
Gujarat's population resides in rural areas, where healthcare infrastructure is less
developed compared to urban centers. Despite recent improvements in
healthcare facilities, such as a 41% increase in primary health centers, rural
regions still face significant disparities in access to medical care.
The project's target location is the villages in Gujarat, where the population often
experiences barriers in accessing timely and adequate healthcare. These areas
are characterized by limited transportation options and long distances to
healthcare facilities, which exacerbate the challenges of managing
cardiovascular diseases. The geographical diversity, from coastal areas to inland
villages, requires a tailored approach to healthcare delivery, emphasizing the
need for portable and culturally appropriate solutions like the wearable ECG
device.

PROTOTYPING
(Prototype v1) (Prototype v2)
After presenting the prototype in Assessment 1, I began working
towards reducing the size and making it more wearable. I was able
to shrink it’s size by removing connectors and tidying up the wiring.
This prototype also performed realtime activity tracking based on
small sample of training data.
The initial prototype was a 3D-printed case covering the board and
sensor, followed by testing digital e-ink displays due to their non-
emissive properties. The primary purpose was to serve as a
communication tool between the device and the user. Drawing
inspiration from emotionally durable design principles, I opted to
showcase animated emojis instead of data to convey the device's
emotions.

(New processor and wiring to reduce size)
After realising I could not reduce to size any further with the screen, I
decided to experiment on a different direction. I chose to use a latest
processor, and with help of AI, I was able to get a functional code to
work with. This was also when I was curating interactions based on
cultural context. I settled on a RGB light to replace screen, and added
button and haptic feedback. I also experimented with attaching
mechanism, as by this time I was trying to make device detachable for
ease of use and maintance.

DESIGNER'S STATEMENT
- TEJAS PATEL
I am Tejas Patel, an Industrial/Product Designer based in Sydney. Born and raised in Gujarat, India, I was deeply
influenced by my cultural heritage. My fascination with creating tangible objects led me to pursue a Bachelor's
degree in Industrial Design. During my undergraduate studies, I discovered my passion for creating meaningful
product interactions, which motivated me to further my education with a Masters in Design at UNSW.
My design philosophy centers on creating meaningful solutions through creative problem-solving. While I adhere
to the principle that form follows function, I also believe in the harmonious integration of form and function within
a given context. This approach allows me to create designs that are not only functional but also culturally resonant
and aesthetically pleasing.
My final design project addresses the healthcare accessibility issues in rural India, where 60% of the population
resides but only 30% of medical professionals practice. The project involves the development of a wearable, Al-
powered ECG monitoring device. This med-tech innovation aims to bring healthcare to people instead of requiring
them to seek it out, thus making healthcare more accessible, less overburdened, and destigmatized. Key features
of the device include real-time ECG and activity monitoring, anomaly detection and user alerts, and a design
inspired by the cultural aesthetics of the Kutch region in Gujarat, allowing the device to blend seamlessly into the
local culture.
The inspiration for this project stemmed from the stark disparity in healthcare accessibility between urban and
rural India. By creating a device that integrates advanced medical technology with cultural sensitivity, the project
aims to address the critical need for accessible healthcare in rural areas.
DESIGNER'S STATEMENT
- TEJAS PATEL
The innovative aspects of my design project include real-time ECG and activity monitoring, providing immediate
health insights, and an Al-powered system that can detect anomalies and alert users, potentially saving lives.
Additionally, the design and form are inspired by the Kutch region's cultural aesthetics, helping to destigmatize
health devices and encourage their use. The strengths of the project lie in its strong cultural connection, suitability
for rural conditions with onboard processing capabilities, and the ability to enable remote health monitoring,
reducing the need for frequent hospital visits. However, there are also weaknesses to consider, such as limited
battery life, which may be insufficient for extended use in remote areas without reliable electricity, the initial cost of
the device, which might be a barrier for widespread adoption in economically disadvantaged communities, and the
challenges of ensuring the privacy and security of health data in a wearable device.
One of the major sustainability considerations in my design process was the decision to make the wearable device
detachable. According to the butterfly diagram from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the innermost loop is
*share*. By designing the device to be detachable, it can be shared within the community, enhancing its
sustainability. Additionally, this design choice protects the device when washing the garment, thereby extending
its lifespan. Ethically, situating the device within the cultural context was paramount. A robust-looking medical
device might discourage use, so the design was made to be culturally sensitive. Moreover, the user interactions and
system flow were designed with the user's comfort and ease of use in mind, ensuring that the device is both
effective and user-friendly.
DESIGNER'S STATEMENT
- TEJAS PATEL
The sustainability and ethical considerations in my design process have reinforced my belief in the significant role
and power of design in society. Designers have the responsibility to create solutions that are not only functional
and aesthetically pleasing but also culturally sensitive and sustainable. In an increasingly uncertain future,
designers must prioritize ethical considerations and sustainability to create products that positively impact society
and the environment.
This course has profoundly influenced my design process and philosophy. It has provided me with the tools and
knowledge to approach design challenges with a holistic perspective, considering not only the functional and
aesthetic aspects but also the cultural, ethical, and sustainability dimensions. For instance, the course content on
sustainable design practices inspired the detachable feature of my wearable device. Additionally, the emphasis on
user-centered design helped me create a product that is both culturally resonant and user-friendly.
In conclusion, my journey through this course and the development of my final design project have been
transformative. They have deepened my understanding of the power and responsibility of design in addressing
real-world problems. As a designer, I am committed to creating solutions that are innovative, sustainable, and
ethically sound, contributing positively to society and the environment.
